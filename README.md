# <span style = 'color : blue'>Covid19 Data Analysis</span>

### Motivation for this Project

In the current scenario when the world is fighting against the COVID19 pandemic, I tried to analyze the **COVID19 Confirmed Dataset** of **John Hopkins University** and **World Happiness Data** and tried to connect some bridges between them. I plotted *Maximum Infection Rates* with *GDP*, *Social Support*, *Healthy Life Expectancy*, and *Freedom to make Life Choices*.



### Primary Goals

- A country wise comparison plot between GDP Per Capita and Maximum Infection Rates 
- A country wise comparison plot between Social Support and Maximum Infection Rates 
- A country wise comparison plot between Healthy Life Expectancy and Maximum Infection Rates 
- A country wise comparison plot between Freedom to make Life Choices and Maximum Infection Rates 



### Datasets Used :

1. [COVID19 Confirmed Dataset](/Datasets/covid19_Confirmed_dataset.csv) 

2. [World Happiness Dataset](/Datasets/worldwide_happiness_report.csv)
